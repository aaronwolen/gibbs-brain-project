# Re-analysis of genomic data generated by Gibbs *et al* 2010

In their [PLoS Genetics paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000952), Gibbs *et al* generated nearly genome-wide measurments of mRNA and methylation levels for 150 individuals, across 4 different brain regions. 

## Data-sets

The expression and methylation datasets are both available from the publication's GEO repository, which also includes microRNA data from the same subjects.

GEO: [GSE15745](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15745)
