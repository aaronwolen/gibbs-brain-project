# Re-analysis of genomic data generated by Gibbs *et al* 2010

In their [PLoS Genetics paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000952), Gibbs *et al* generated nearly genome-wide measurments of mRNA and methylation levels for 150 individuals, across 4 different brain regions. 

## Data-sets

The expression and methylation datasets are both available from the publication's GEO repository, which also includes microRNA data from the same subjects.

GEO: [GSE15745](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15745)

The paper points to the following dbGAP page but authorization must be obtained to download it.

## Downloading the data

## Running the analyses

### Methylation and mRNA correlations

#### Adjust methylation and expression data for age and tissue bank
`Rscript crossdata-correlations-meth-exp-adjust-data.r`

__Output:__ 
* data/crossdata-correlations-meth-exp/eset-meth-adjusted.rda
* data/crossdata-correlations-meth-exp/eset-exp-adjusted.rda

#### Calculate methylation/expression correlations
`Rscript crossdata-correlations-meth-exp-analysis.r`

__Output:__
* results/crossdata-meth-exp-correlations.csv

#### Generate report
`Rscript -e 'knitr::knit("crossdata-correlations-meth-exp-report.Rmd")'`
