# Analysis of methylation/expression data generated by Gibbs et al

## Background

## Dataset

The expression and methylation datasets are both available from GEO and also includes microRNA data.

GEO: [GSE15745](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15745)

The paper points to the following dbGAP page but authorization must be obtained to download it.

dbGAP: [phs000249.v1.p](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000249.v1.p1)

## Samples

The supplementary table 1 contains phenotype data for sample BLSA-2021, for which there is no corresponding data in the geo dataset.
