# Re-analysis of genomic data generated by Gibbs *et al* 2010

In their [PLoS Genetics paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000952), Gibbs *et al* generated nearly genome-wide measurments of mRNA and methylation levels for 150 individuals, across 4 different brain regions. 

## Data-sets

The expression and methylation datasets are both available from the publication's GEO repository, which also includes microRNA data from the same subjects.

GEO: [GSE15745](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15745)

The paper points to the following dbGAP page but authorization must be obtained to download it.

## Running the analyses

### Methylation and mRNA correlations

#### Run analysis
`Rscript crossdata-correlations-meth-exp-analysis.r`

Output:
* results/crossdata-meth-exp-correlations.csv

#### Generate report
`Rscript -e 'knitr::knit("crossdata-correlations-meth-exp-report.Rmd")'`


### microRNA and mRNA correlations
Correlations are calculated between microRNAs and the mRNAs they putatively target.  
Predicted microRNA/mRNA interactions are provided by the [`RmiR.hsa`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.10/data/annotation/html/RmiR.hsa.html) package, which includes prediction results from 7 different databases: 
* miranda
* mirbase
* mirtarget2
* pictar
* tarbase
* targetscan

The cross-data correlations can be calculated based on the predictions from any of these databases by setting `mirdb` when running the script.

#### Run analysis
`Rscript crossdata-correlations-micro-exp-analysis.r "mirdb='tarbase'"`

Output:
* results/crossdata-micro-exp-correlations-tarbase.rda

#### Generate report
`Rscript -e 'knitr::knit("crossdata-correlations-micro-exp-report.Rmd")'`
